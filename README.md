# Jibel Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library

## Why should I use JMP?

+ Using the fastest mathematical algorithms
+ Low memory usage
+ No memory leak
+ Single CPU core usage
+ If you want to know how you can multiply, sum, or ... big numbers in a fast time and with low memory usage you can use the JMP library with simple and fast codes.
This library is for programmers who want to simply know how GMP multiplies two 2 million numbers together in under one second.

## Features for now

+ Summation
+ Subtraction
+ Multiplication
+ Exponentiation

## Benchmark on Core I7 11800H CPU

+ 1.2 Million digits number multiply by 1.2 million digits number: 5.5sec
+ 2 to the power of 10000: 9.49sec

**Notice: All of the JMP numbers in on std::string**
